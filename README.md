# Light-FTI-FDet
Source code for the paper "Real-time Vision Based System of Fault Detection for Freight Trains". The Light-FTI-FDet paper can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8911418).

The Light_FTI-FDet is modified from [FTI-FDet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8451188).


### Codes
A caffe implementation of fault detection network based on Faster RCNN (follow [Soft-NMS](https://github.com/bharatsingh430/soft-nms)).

### Datasets and pre-train weights
Coming soon!
